# AGI Project - README

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a powerful AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) system with multiple capabilities, including LLM-based chatting, knowledge base retrieval, web queries, text-to-image generation, image-to-text conversion, and speech-based Q&A. The system is based on **LangChain**, supports **FastAPI**, and is compatible with **OpenWebUI**, designed to provide developers with a highly available and extensible intelligent agent framework.

## Features

- **LLM Chat**: Supports natural language conversation based on large language models (LLMs).
- **Knowledge Base Retrieval**: Capable of retrieving information from a predefined knowledge base to provide more accurate answers.
- **Web Query**: Integrated web query functionality that fetches real-time information from the internet based on user requests.
- **Text to Image**: Supports generating images from textual descriptions, providing rich visual content.
- **Image to Text**: Supports converting images into textual descriptions, capable of understanding and interpreting image content.
- **Speech Q&A**: Integrates speech recognition and synthesis to enable voice-based question-answer interactions.

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: The core framework, supporting flexible LLM integration and pipeline management.
- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building the API service.
- **OpenWebUI**: Compatible with OpenWebUI, allowing users to interact and manage the system through a visual interface.
- **Additional Tools**: Integrates various third-party tools for implementing the features like text-to-image generation, speech recognition, etc.
